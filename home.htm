			<h2>5 Goals I Will Accomplish in 2017</h2>
			<img src="_images/success.jpeg" alt="success" width="75%" height="20%">
			<p>Hey there! If you don&rsquo;t know me, this is my very first blog post! And what better way to start your first blog other that than setting up new goals and resolutions for the upcoming year. These are the five goals I <strong>will</strong> accomplish in 2017. This list will be in no particular order, so let&rsquo;s get started!</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>#1: Graduate Highschool</h3>
			<p>Of course, I want to start with the obvious, which is finishing my secondary education. I have learned throughout the years that highschool is not a place where you can find your careers in the future (I certainly didn&rsquo;t get that) but rather, it&rsquo;s a place where you can develop good work ethics, responsibilities and habits in the future for when you will get to tackle the big stuff. Whether you are going to post-secondary (college, university) or risking it on your own and going out in to the real world, you will find that good habits and work ethics are keys to success regardless of what you are going to do in your life.</p>
			<img src="_images/grad.jpeg" alt="graduation" width="75%" height="20%">
			<p>As for me, my goal for finishing highschool is to finally receive my very first Honour Roll, which I never received due to poor marks from past years. But getting the Honour Roll is not really for me, it&rsquo;s for my parents. Last year I told them that I wasn&rsquo;t planning on going to college or univesity but rather, start working right away and learning the required skills along the way. Of course, as any parents would say or do they didn&rsquo;t like the idea, now that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they won&rsquo;t support me, this was something that was new to them. They came from a country (Philippines) where there was no opportunity to make a living unless you were educated and it&rsquo;s in their tradition for their children to graduate from college, get a good job and have a family. Sounds awefully like the America Dream right? Well it is the American dream but it <em>wasn&rsquo;t my dream</em>, it&rsquo;s not what I wanted for my life. I wanted something more, something that my parents or anyone that I know aren&rsquo;t willing to do or risk. And that is escaping traditions and the norms and doing something incredible and fulfilling. Travelling.</p>

			<h3>#2: Teaching Myself How to Code</h3>
			<p>One of the biggest challenges I will have to face this year would be to give myself value, a skill that will make me noticeable to prospecting clients and employers, and what&rsquo;s a better way to do that than teaching myself how to code. In this day and age, as the information technology continues to advance and improve, there is a greater demand for people who know the web inside and out. To me, coding has always been in the back of my mind for a long time I&rsquo;ve always wanted to know what coding is but my fear has always got the best of me. Mostly because of me being intimidated by all the jargon that developers were typing out on their screens. But not anymore, I&rsquo;ve seen what web developers can do and the things that they can create and I want to create things that would be useful to other people.</p>

			<p>Ever since I was a little kid I have always had a higer sense of imagination, and I think everyone had. I love creating new things that are unique and different. And I think that web development as a skill, will help me fulfill my goal of just creating, creating things that would be useful to me and other people. Web development will also help me fulfill my lifestyle of being a digital nomad. One of the biggest aspirations in my life is travelling and what better way to travel around the world than working on something that I love at the same time.</p>

			<h3>#3: Making Connections</h3>
			<img src="_images/collaborate.jpg" alt="networking" width="75%" height="20%">
			<p>What&rsquo;s the point of acquiring a valuable skill if people don&rsquo;t know anything about? That&rsquo;s why my next step would be to network with like minded individuals who are willing to make a new connection in their books. I should by now know the skill that I have aqcuired or atleast have a broad understanding of the field. My goal for making connections is to not make myself hireable but rather make friends. My reason for this is because the people I am going to network with might not need my specific skill, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t know anyone who will. I also try to make myself presentable and approachable so a good body language is key when it comes to meeting new people. Especially if those people are going to be that ones who will hire you or know someone who wants to hire you. </p>

			<h3>#4: Owning Up to My Responsibilities and Improving Personal Growth</h3>
			<p>Of course one of the many, terrible curses of adulthood are responsibilities. By this time I should be at my prime age of 18, made connections, have a considerable degree of knowledge when it comes to my craft and maybe have made some decent money along the way using my newfound skills. But owning up to my responsibilities at this time should be my main priority. As a legal adult I need to set up new health insurances, opening up new bank accounts for both personal and professional use, as well as getting my driver&rsquo;s licence. During at this stage of the year, I should also improve my personal growth when it comes to my work ethics, habits, discipline, and most importantly my confidence.</p>
			<img src="_images/man.jpeg" alt="selfgrowth" width="75%" height="20%">
			<p>Confidence is key when it comes to success, you need to be confident in order for your plans to work it's simple math. Although watch out when it comes to how you project your confidence it can make you look cocky which can be a disadvantage when meeting new clients or employers. As Han Solo once said to Luke Skywalker: "Don't get too cocky kid." </p>

			<h3>#5: Begin My Plans for Travel</h3>
			<img src="_images/planning.jpeg" alt="travel" width="75%" height="20%">
			<p><strong>Year 2018 will be my year</strong>, the year when I will start my life as a digital nomad. Year 2017 is the year that will make this happen. 2017 for me is the year of preperation, and year 2018 is the year of independance. By this time I should have my career as a web developer started, made a substantial amount of money that will help me travel, as well as preparing my necessities and amenities in check for the next year. I believe that next year will be a tough year for my parents because their oldest son will be on his own so early on his life. Of course, I will do all that I can to help get through this tough transition by telling them my plans, giving them my main income and how I will make my lifestyle sustainable in my long travels around the world. Travel is everything to me and I know in the future my parents will understand, but for now I will do all that I can to make this into a peaceful transition for them.</p>
